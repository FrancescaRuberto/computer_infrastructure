## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

To ensure accessibility and consistency across different environments, I chose to use **GitHub Codespaces** for this project.  
Codespaces allows development directly in the cloud, from **any device**, without the need for a specific local setup — an advantage that promotes productivity and flexibility.

### Steps to Set Up and Run

1. **Open the repository** in GitHub.  
2. Click on the **“Code”** button and select the **“Codespaces”** tab.  
3. Choose **“Create codespace on main”** (or the relevant branch).  
4. Once the Codespace environment is ready, you can:
   - Run the notebooks or scripts directly in the integrated terminal.
   - Install additional dependencies if needed using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
5. All necessary **data files** and **notebooks** are organized within the repository folders for straightforward execution.
